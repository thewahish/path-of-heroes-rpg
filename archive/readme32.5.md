üåç HUD & Global UI
This section defines the behavior of persistent, global UI elements.
 * Global Elements: The top bar containing Floor Number, Gold Count, and the Inventory Button is a global element.
 * Visibility Rule: These global elements should only be visible on screens that appear after Character Selection (e.g., Dungeon Map, Battle, Shop, Shrine, Campfire). They must not appear on the Main Menu or Character Selection screens.
 * Language Toggle: The language toggle button is a global component with a fixed position throughout the entire application and is not considered part of any specific screen's content area.

‚öîÔ∏è Combat System
(Combat mechanics remain unchanged, but the UI is now defined by designs/battle.html)
üéí Inventory, Loot & Potions
 * Loot Drop Rules:
   * Standard Enemies: Every non-boss enemy is guaranteed to drop loot upon defeat.
   * Bosses: Bosses drop a selection of major, higher-quality loot.
   * (Developer Note: This "always drop" rule requires updating the current percentage-based dropChance logic.)
 * Potions & Consumables:
   * Types: Players can find and use various consumables. Confirmed types include:
     * Health Potion: Restores health.
     * Elixir: Restores a primary resource (Vigor, Mana, etc.).
     * Antidote: Cures negative status effects like poison.
   * Acquisition: These items can be found as loot, purchased from Shops, or awarded at Shrines.
   * Usage: Using a consumable during combat counts as a player's turn.
