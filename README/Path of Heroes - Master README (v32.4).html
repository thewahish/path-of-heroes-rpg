🎨 UI Design Principles & Color Palette
Golden Rules:

Portrait-Only: All screens are designed and optimized exclusively for portrait orientation.

Static Layouts: All UI elements, especially those containing text like buttons and panels, must have static, fixed dimensions. These dimensions should be calculated to accommodate the text of all supported languages without causing the element to resize or shift the layout. Text within these elements should be centered to handle varying string lengths gracefully.

No Scrolling: UI layouts must fit within a standard mobile viewport without vertical scrolling.

Note: The shop.html design includes a scrollable item grid (overflow-y: auto). This should be reviewed to align with the no-scrolling principle, perhaps by implementing a paginated view.

Safe Zones: All interactive UI elements should be contained within 80-95% of the screen area to ensure accessibility on all devices.

No Redundant Globals: Global controls like the language toggle are part of the main game shell and should not be included in individual screen mockups.
