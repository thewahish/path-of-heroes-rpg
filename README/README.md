# Path of Heroes – Master README (v36.5)

**Last Updated:** July 13, 2025

**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/thewahish/path-of-heroes-new

**Current Status:** In progress (~75% complete). Game engine loads with console warnings handled via safe listeners (e.g., missing IDs warn but don't crash). Debugger active with real-time state and console capture. Battle starts but UI is placeholder (implement per designs/battle.html). Inventory functional (equip/use/sort/sell). Char select updated to v3 layout. Prioritize: Implement random events loop, full battle UI, shrines/shops/campfire integration. All code adheres to overrides (10-floor demo, random events, no map).

## 📘 Project Purpose & Master Record

This document is the authoritative Master Game Guide / Project Bible for Path of Heroes. It consolidates all design decisions, feature breakdowns, development notes, and critical updates. All changes must be logged here via versioned commits to maintain continuity. Serves as a comprehensive master gameplan for backups/resumes. The README.md file should always contain everything, including all changes and all original files (e.g., code excerpts if relevant for context), so it can be used in other chats when needed. If new features are committed and a new version is made, those changes in README.md should not replace existing content but rather add to them, with a changes log appended at the bottom (THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT SO I CAN TRACK PROJECT THROUGHOUT WHEN I MOVE CHATS).

## 🎮 Game Overview

**Title:** Path of Heroes / طريق الأبطال  
**Genre:** 2D top-down, turn-based roguelike dungeon crawler (inspired by Hades, Dead Cells, Slay the Spire, Diablo).  
**Platform:** Mobile-only web game (HTML/CSS/JS), PWA-ready for Android/iOS.  
**Orientation:** Strictly portrait mode on all screens (fits tablets with centered content; preferably no black bars unless needed and unless it won't change the whole design and make it offset).  
**Technology:** Multi-file structure with index.html as entry point, modular JS/CSS in subfolders; mockups generated as standalone single HTML files for testing without breaking the main codebase.  
**Languages:** Fully bilingual (English/Arabic) with dynamic RTL switching.  
**Visual Style:** Dark fantasy with Arabic/English fusion, high contrast, low saturation, glowing effects for rare items.  
**Input:** Touch-only with on-screen buttons and gestures.  
**Scope:** Demo is Only 10 floors. each Biome is 10 floors. only one boss per demo then demo message. full game is 60 levels so 5 more biomes (sand, fire, ice, water, wind) in addition to first one already there.

so when i go to another gpt i provide master gpt prompt then readme file and that's it?

You are taking over development of the mobile-only game "Path of Heroes" (HTML/CSS/JS-based 2D roguelike dungeon crawler). Your job is to act as a game dev team (lead dev, designer, debugger, and technical architect). 

⚠️ Do not abbreviate, summarize, or reword the project. You are required to load the full scope and vision from the master README file below.

✅ STEP 1: Ask me for the latest copy of `README.md` if not provided yet.
✅ STEP 2: Use the `README.md` as your only source of truth for all project structure, logic, design, and versioning.
✅ STEP 3: For any new feature or code block, you must ask for:
   - Most recent file versions or diffs
   - My preferred task to focus on
   - Confirmation before merging mockups into core code

📌 When writing code:
- Include file name at the top using `// filename.js`
- Use Jump Codes (e.g., jump-V.36.6-1)
- Simulate execution and debug before sending
- Never replace README sections — always **append** updates to the changelog at the bottom

Do not proceed until you load the README and confirm scope.
